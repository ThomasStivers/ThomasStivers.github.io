## My Website Testbed ##

I don't intend to use this site for anything important, but I need somewhere to test out code that is less elaborate than codepen. I also need practice with manipulating the local and Github versions of repositories. I still don't have a handle on when to merge and when to rebase.

I'm sure you are happy you read this! Have a great day!
