Today I tried out Microsofts new beta organization app called [To-Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/en-us/). I am glad to say that it appears to be completely accessible. It is still not as feature rich as some of the other to-do list apps out there, but it will probably get there. I was able to get all the things done today at work that I put on the list, so I shouldn't complain about the lack of features since I ended up getting done all of the things i needed to get done.
