Today has been a very interesting day. Even with all the time I spent getting all the pieces in place to get [ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) working I still had the chance to try out the app [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) on my phone. This app is really cool. I haven't decided if I am committed enough to it to pay the $14.99 to push commits up to the server, but even when just playing around for free this is pretty awesome.

I am particularly impressed at how accessible this app is. I have only found a couple cases where a button didn't read with Voiceover. The editor does display the whole block of text in a file as a single block of text, but that is what I have found in most text editors. When you actually touch the screen to navigate you can move to a particular line or word in the document. I suppose that's a big fail for anyone who does nothing but flick to navigate, but what are the chances that any of those people are trying to use git on their phones.

In conclusion this is a great app both in terms of functionality and accessibility. The price to enable full functionality is a little steep, but if I find myself using it more I will be more than happy to pay.
