Yesterday the [Echo Dot](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Amazon-Echo-Dot-Add-Alexa-To-Any-Room/dp/B01DFKC2SO?th=1) from Amazon came in the mail. Heather and I purchased the Dot to play music and use as an alarm clock in the bedroom. Now that we have it working I am happy with the product, but the setup process was a total pain in the ass!

We plugged in the Dot and waited for the lovely little sound that means it is ready for setup. The message about setting up in the Alexa app was spoken, and we thought we were on our way. Heather began the setup process on her phone. All was well until she reached the screen to select a language. She said the screen went black and all she could do was to close and restart the Alexa app. We both went through this process 3 times on each of our phones before I finally got the language chosen. I have no idea what changed to make it work, but I suppose solving a problem by repeatedly bashing it with a stick is reasonable...

The Dot has been working just fine since we got it set up, but the setup process itself really did leave a bad taste in both our mouthes.
