title: Ruby is Complicated!

After putting it off for weeks I finally decided to install a ruby development environment to run Jekyll (the platform this site runs on) locally. What I learned is that working with ruby is complicated as hell! The language itself seems simple, but there are so many layers of complexity on top of the language itself. I had to:
- read multiple guides on setting up a github.io site
- install ruby
- install the ruby development kit
- create a "Gemfile"
- run some arbitrary shell commands
- finally run a local server to host this site
Happily I got it all done, but in the end I found out that the only reason github.io didn't like my site was the double right pointing angle bracket in the example blog post layout I got from the setup guide. All in all it was a good learning experience, but terrible user experience.
