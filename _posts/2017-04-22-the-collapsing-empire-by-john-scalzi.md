The latest book I am reading is [John Scalzi](https://www.scalzi.com/)'s [*The Collapsing Empire*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30078567-the-collapsing-empire). I am a huge Scalzi fan since reading all of the [*Old Man's War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man%27s_War) series shortly after the first book, his first novel, came out. I even follow [@scalzi](https://twitter.com/scalzi) with all his ranting on Twitter.

In *The Collapsing Empire* humanity has colonized 47 systems, but only one of them has a habitable planet. Earth has been lost in the distant past. The galactic empire, called The Interdependency, is connected by the flow, a spacetime oddity which allows ships to travel faster than light through streams of naturally occurring fast spacetime. The civilization is entirely interdependent with its many colonies, and consequently entirely dependent on the flow. The flow is not as constant as everyone thinks, and soon will collapse.

I'm pretty sure they should have learned not to rely on the flow when they **LOST THE EARTH**, but still for some reason these future people spread through all those uninhabitable systems. I'm all for not keeping all our eggs in one basket, but that doesn't mean that we should secure all the eggs above a pit of spikes using silly string.

*Collapsing Empire* is an interesting book, but I'm about 50% through it and I don't quite love it yet. It definitely reminds me strongly of [Isaac Asimov](http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_home_page.html)'s [*The Currents of Space*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Currents_of_Space), but with all the years that have passed, and all the [galactic empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(disambiguation)) that have risen and fallen, this book doesn't feel original to me. I do like that the empero, and our protagonist, is a woman. Isaac may have been willing to give that a shot, but He'd have had a hell of a time getting it published in 1952.

Following up; I have finished the book. I'm still not very impressed. The book's political machinations don't ring true to me. All the characters behave rationally which just doesn't happen in politics. I will almost certainly check the next book in The Interdependency series out from the library, but I don't think I'll use another Audible credit on it.
