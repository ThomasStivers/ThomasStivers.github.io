The latest book I am reading is [John Scalzi](https://www.scalzi.com/)'s [*The Collapsing Empire*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30078567-the-collapsing-empire). I am a huge Scalzi fan since reading all of the [*Old Man's War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man%27s_War) series shortly after the first book, his first novel, came out. I even follow [@scalzi](https://twitter.com/scalzi) with all his ranting on Twitter.

*Collapsing Empire* is an interesting book, but I'm about 50% through it and I don't quite love it yet. It definitely reminds me strongly of [Isaac Asimov](http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_home_page.html)'s [*The Currents of Space*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Currents_of_Space), but with all the years that have passed, and all the [galactic empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(disambiguation)) that have risen and fallen, this book doesn't feel original to me. I do like that the empero, and our protagonist, is a woman. Isaac may have been willing to give that a shot, but He'd have had a hell of a time getting it published in 1952.
