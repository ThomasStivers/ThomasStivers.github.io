Yesterday evening I got confirmation that Heather and I will be going to [Maker Faire](http://makerfaire.com/) as part of the [San Francisco Lighthouse](http://lighthouse-sf.org)'s Maker Faire Made Accessible program! I am looking forward to this trip a lot. Dad and i did all kinds of electronic projects when I was a kid, but I haven't kept up the skills from those days. IN addition to all the fun we'll have playing with soldering irons and [Raspberry Pies](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) we will get to spend some time with Adam, Richie, and JJ who we haven't seen for years.

As proof that Heather needs to be at the faire she has been letting her nerd flag fly. We were discussing the accessibility of a [wi-fi enabled hydrometer](https://tilthydrometer.com/products/brewometer) for measuring the specific gravity of beer. She said she would love to be able to ferment directly in the keg in order to avoid the hassle of transferring the wort. If we were to do this it would be difficult or impossible to check the gravity of the beer during fermentation. With a wi-fi hydrometer we could leave it in the keg and read it remotely. I asked her, "What is another name for a keg?" Her answer, with no hesitation, "a [Faraday cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage)". That pretty much made my day, and definitely qualifies Heather as someone with real maker potential." That's why Heather is the best!
