title: I've Been Drafted

I am writing a post in yet another app just for kicks. This time I am using [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/) where I have created an action to place this file into the correct place in my OneDrive so that when I next do a git commit it will get posted to my github.io [blog](https://thomasstivers.github.io/blog). Something tells me this will almost certainly not owrk right the first time, but I'll never know if i don't try. I don't know how to get the title of a draft in all lower case with all the spaces replaced with dashes. That is needed for the file name, so we'll see how it works without it.

Here goes nothing!
