After finishing [*The Collapsing Empire*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-04-22-the-collapsing-empire-by-john-scalzi %}) I am jumping back into the [Bobiverse](https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752) with [*For We Are Many*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33395557-for-we-are-many). I had a great time with [*We Are Legion (We Are Bob)*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32109569-we-are-legion-we-are-bob) so I picked up *For We Are Many* on the day it was released. Mr. Taylor's speed in writing these books is amazing. On [Mr. Taylor's blog](http://dennisetaylor.org/) he  says we can expect the next book by August of this year. Apparently that even includes some delays.

*For We Are Many* is most definitely the continuation of a series. If you have not started with *My Name Is Legion* you will be completely confused, but if you start at the beginning this is a fun romp through Bob's life as a [Von Neumann probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_universal_constructor). Humanity is down to only 15,000,000 after a nuclear war, but only is a relative term. At 10,000 colonists per trip Bob, or more specificly Bob's copy in the solar system Ryker, has to build 1,500 ships or take 1,500 trips to get everyone of the earth which is no longer livable. Colonizations are few and far between, and the Bobs have to convince the remaining population to settle for some high risk environments.

Meanwhile, Bobs aren't the only resource hungry entities in this galactic neighborhood. Something is stripping all the metals from systems and killing everything while they're at it. They aren't even leaving the bodies behind. Didn't I mention they are hungry? Bob will have to stop the aliens before the last remaining humans become a midnight snack.

Bobs are like rabbits. They replicate fast and often. I found it hard to keep track of which Bob was in which system doing what. I also have trouble getting my head around Bob's extreme lack of effective weaponry. With all the delightful ways of putting holes in things Bob[0] should have picked up from his exposure to science fiction I am baffled by the fact that the primary weapon the Bobs use are self propelled  steel balls. Even given his aversion to explosives there are so many other ways to do nasty things to the enemy in space.
