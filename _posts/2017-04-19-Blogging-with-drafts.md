I am trying out an updated version of my post to github.io action in Drafts. I added a javascript block to convert spaces to dashes when writing the filename to save the markdown in. For some reason I cannot seem to get the string.toLower() function to work right in Drafts. I wonder if they are using a different version of the javascript library than the reference i looked at which had the toLower() function in it.

Okay so that is the end of the test. Now I will fire it up and see what breaks.

Follow-up, I just revisited the javascript string methods reference, and I am an idiot. I was remembering wrong and the method I want is string.toLowerCase(). Oops!
